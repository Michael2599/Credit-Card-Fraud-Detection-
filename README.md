# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

## Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data using machine learning algorithms. It utilizes [] to build a fraud detection system.

## Features
- id: Unique identifier for each transaction
- V1-V28: Anonymized features representing various transaction attributes (e.g., time, location, etc.)
- Amount: The transaction amount
- Class: Binary label indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0)
   
## Dataset Information
The dataset used for this project contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders in the year 2023. It comprises over 550,000 records, and the data has been anonymized to protect the cardholders' identities. 

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook, etc.

## Methodology
1. Data preprocessing
2. Model selection
